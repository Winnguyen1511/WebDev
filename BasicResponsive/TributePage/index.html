            <h3>Here's a time line of User Story</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>1998</strong>-Alistair Cockburn visited the Chrysler C3 project in Detroit and coined the phrase "A user story is a promise for a conversation."</li>
                <li><strong>1999</strong>-Kent Beck published the first edition of the book <em>Extreme Programming Explained</em>, introducing Extreme Programming (XP),[4] and the usage of user stories in the planning game.</li>
                <li><strong>2001</strong>-Ron Jeffries proposed a "Three Cs" formula for user story creation:
                    <ul>
                        <li>The <em>Card</em> (or often a post-it note) is a tangible physical token to hold the concepts</li>
                        <li>The <em>Conversation</em> is between the stakeholders (customers, users, developers, testers, etc.). It is verbal and often supplemented by documentation;</li>
                        <li>The <em>Confirmation</em> ensures that the objectives of the conversation have been reached.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li><strong>2001</strong>-The XP team at Connextra[6] in London devised the user story format and shared examples with others.</li>
                <li><strong>2004</strong>-Mike Cohn generalized the principles of user stories beyond the usage of cards in his book <em>User Stories Applied: For Agile Software Development</em>[7] that is now considered the standard reference for the topic according to Martin Fowler.[8] Cohn names Rachel Davies as the inventor of user stories.[citation needed] While Davies was a team member at Connextra she credits the team as a whole with the invention.</li>
                <li><strong>2014</strong>-After a first article in 2005[9] and a blog post in 2008,[10] in 2014 Jeff Patton published the user-story mapping technique, which intends to improve with a systematic approach the identification of user stories and to structure the stories to give better visibility to their interdependence.</li>
